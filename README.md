# Minesweeper-Python
A recreation of Minesweeper in Python

The first click on the board reveals an empty square, and any further clicks on unvisited squares will reveal the square.

Clicking an uncovered squares will reveal all squares surrounding that square.

Note that this project is not a recent creation, so it may be a partially outdated representation of my coding style.
